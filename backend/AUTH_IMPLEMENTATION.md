# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete authentication system for the Pathavana backend with JWT-based authentication ensuring users can only access their own trips and chat sessions after signing in.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication Endpoints
- **POST /api/auth/signup** - Create new user account
  - Email validation
  - Password strength requirements (min 8 chars, uppercase, digit)
  - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
  - Returns JWT access token

- **POST /api/auth/signin** - User login
  - Email/password verification
  - Returns JWT access token
  - Token expires after configured time

- **GET /api/auth/me** - Get current user info
  - Requires valid JWT token
  - Returns user profile information

- **POST /api/auth/signout** - Logout endpoint

### 2. Protected Endpoints
All the following endpoints now require authentication:

#### Trips (/api/trips)
- GET /api/trips - Lists only trips belonging to authenticated user
- POST /api/trips - Creates trip for authenticated user
- GET /api/trips/{id} - Returns trip only if owned by user
- PUT /api/trips/{id} - Updates trip only if owned by user
- DELETE /api/trips/{id} - Deletes trip only if owned by user

#### Travelers (/api/travelers)
- GET /api/travelers - Lists only travelers belonging to authenticated user
- POST /api/travelers - Creates traveler for authenticated user
- GET /api/travelers/{id} - Returns traveler only if owned by user
- PUT /api/travelers/{id} - Updates traveler only if owned by user
- DELETE /api/travelers/{id} - Deletes traveler only if owned by user

#### Travel Sessions (/api/travel/sessions)
- POST /api/travel/sessions - Creates chat session for authenticated user
- GET /api/travel/sessions/{id} - Returns session only if owned by user
- PUT /api/travel/sessions/{id} - Updates session only if owned by user

### 3. Security Features
- JWT tokens with HS256 algorithm
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Token expiration (configurable, default 30 days)
- Bearer token authentication
- User data isolation - users can only access their own resources
- Proper error responses for unauthorized access (401/403)

### 4. Database Schema
- Users table with password_hash field
- All resource tables (trips, travelers, travel_sessions) have user_id foreign key
- Queries filter by authenticated user_id

## Testing
Created comprehensive test script (test_auth.py) that verifies:
1. User signup
2. User signin
3. Token generation and validation
4. Protected endpoint access control
5. User data isolation
6. CRUD operations with authentication

## API Documentation
FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/api/redoc

## Usage Example

```python
# 1. Sign up
POST /api/auth/signup
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "full_name": "John Doe"
}

# Response
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 2592000,
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "is_active": true
  }
}

# 2. Use token for protected endpoints
GET /api/trips
Headers: Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...

# Only returns trips for authenticated user
```

## Important Notes
- Always run within virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- All dependencies are installed via requirements.txt
- Never use fallback/simpler versions - use proper dependencies
- Authentication is required for all data operations
- Users can only see and modify their own data
