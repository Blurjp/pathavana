# Feature: AI-Driven Trip Plan Creation

## Overview
This feature enables the AI agent to automatically detect when users want to create a trip plan and creates it seamlessly within the chat conversation.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Trip Context Service** (`backend/app/services/trip_context_service.py`)
   - Added `detect_trip_plan_intent()` method that analyzes user messages
   - Detects explicit phrases like "create a trip plan", "help me plan", etc.
   - Returns intent with confidence score and extracted trip information

2. **Travel Session Database Service** (`backend/app/services/travel_session_db.py`)
   - Modified `_generate_ai_response()` to check for trip plan intent
   - When intent is detected, automatically creates trip plan structure in session's `plan_data`
   - Adds `trip_plan_created` flag to response metadata

3. **Trip Plan Structure**
   ```json
   {
     "trip": {
       "id": "unique-id",
       "name": "Trip to [destination]",
       "destination": "extracted destination",
       "departure_date": "extracted or null",
       "return_date": "extracted or null", 
       "travelers": "extracted or 1",
       "status": "planning",
       "saved_items": []
     }
   }
   ```

### Frontend Changes

1. **UnifiedTravelRequest Component** (`frontend/src/pages/UnifiedTravelRequest.tsx`)
   - Added effect to monitor messages for `trip_plan_created` metadata
   - Automatically opens sidebar when trip plan is created
   - Shows trip plan in the sidebar's Trip Plan tab

2. **Trip Plan Panel Integration**
   - Uses existing `TripPlanPanel` component
   - Reads trip data from session's `plan_data.trip`
   - Allows adding searched items to the trip plan

## Trip Plan Intent Detection

### Explicit Phrases Detected:
- "create a trip plan"
- "create my trip plan"
- "make a trip plan"
- "build a trip plan"
- "start planning my trip"
- "plan my trip"
- "create an itinerary"
- "build my itinerary"
- "organize my trip"
- "help me plan"
- "save my trip"
- "add to my trip plan"

### Implicit Detection:
- When user provides destination + dates with planning context
- When user wants to add search results to a trip
- During ongoing trip planning conversations

## User Flow

1. User types: "Create a trip plan to Paris for next week"
2. Backend detects trip plan intent (confidence: 0.95)
3. AI responds acknowledging trip creation
4. Trip plan is created in session data
5. Frontend detects `trip_plan_created` in response metadata
6. Sidebar opens automatically showing the new trip plan
7. User can now search and add items to their trip

## Testing

### Unit Tests Created:
1. `TripPlanCreationBasic.test.tsx` - Tests basic trip plan creation flow
2. `tripPlanIntentDetection.test.ts` - Tests intent detection logic

### Manual Testing:
See `frontend/src/tests/manual-test-trip-plan.md` for detailed manual test procedures.

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Experience**: Users don't need to navigate to a separate page
2. **Natural Language**: Works with how users naturally express their intent
3. **Automatic Context**: Extracts trip details from conversation
4. **Integrated Workflow**: Search results can be immediately added to trip plan

## Future Enhancements

1. More sophisticated NLP for intent detection
2. Support for multi-city trip plans
3. Automatic itinerary suggestions based on destination
4. Collaborative trip planning features
5. Export trip plan to calendar/PDF formats
